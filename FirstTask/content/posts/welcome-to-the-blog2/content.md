<p>Static site generators (SSGs) were once considered outdated. But in recent years, they've been making a huge comeback. Why? The web is evolving — and performance, security, and simplicity are more important than ever.</p>
<h2>🚀 Performance</h2>
<p>Static sites are pre-built. That means when a user requests a page, the server doesn’t have to build it on the fly — it simply serves the file. This results in <em>lightning-fast load times</em>, which directly impact user satisfaction and SEO rankings.</p>
<h2>🔐 Security</h2>
<p>Since there’s no database or dynamic backend, there's <em>less surface area for attacks</em> like SQL injection. Most SSGs are deployed via CDNs, which adds an additional layer of protection.</p>
<h2>💡 Simplicity</h2>
<p>With tools like Jekyll, Hugo, and Eleventy, you can build a blog or full site using just Markdown and templates. This allows developers to <em>focus on content</em>, not backend</p>
